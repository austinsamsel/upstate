      <p>In order to create beautiful, useful digital products I listen to my clients. I also listen to their audience. Then I work to create measurable results. As I build, thereâ€™s lots of communication and feedback and my clients get to see their projects develop. This is how we get it right. <a href="#Contact">Want to talk about your project?

        Hi, I'm Austin Samsel. I'm both a visual designer and a programmer. I've been doing this thing for about five years. I've learned empathy is everything: good stuff happens when we help others fulfill their needs. You can be my friend on twitter: <a href="http://twitter.com/austinsamsel">@austinsamsel</a>
